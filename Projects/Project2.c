/*
PROJECT 2: SNAKE, WATER, GUN 
Snake, water, gun or rock, paper, scissors is a game most of us have played during 
school time. (I sometimes play it even now). 
Write a C program capable of playing this game with you. 
Your program should be able to print the result after you choose snake/water or gun.

/*
Inputs may be:
Rock/Snake
Paper/Water 
Scissor/Gun
Sure! In the Snake, Water, Gun game (a fun variant of Rock, Paper, Scissors), there are 3 choices:

üíß Water

üî´ Gun

Each player picks one, and the outcome is decided based on the following rules:

üéÆ Rules:
Snake drinks Water ‚Üí Snake wins
Water douses Gun ‚Üí Water wins
Gun kills Snake ‚Üí Gun wins
Same choices ‚Üí Draw

‚úÖ All Possible Player vs Computer Input Combinations (9 Total)
Player	Computer	Result
